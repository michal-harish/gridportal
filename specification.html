	<h2><a name="HTPP">1. Http Portlet Protocol/1.1 - Draft/8th August 2010</a></h2>
	<h3>1.1. Architecture overview</h3>
	<ol>
		<li><strong>Portal</strong> - front end server that handles user requests</li>
		<li><strong>Portlets</strong>- the distributed components that are invoked via server-to-server http requests from the Portal's container</li>
		<li><strong>Proxy</strong> - optional proxy between Portal and Portlets for high availability via asynchronous multi-casting</li>	
	</ol>	
	<ul>
		<li>this is a specification of communication path from portal to each individual portlet</li>
		<li>portlet is not aware of the client request URL ( so it cannot create links and redirects ) </li>
		<li>portlets receive all actions via html forms, method="get" or method="post"</li>
		<li>portlet has got a toplevel element &lt;body&gt; which is ignored on the portal
			<ul>
				<li>every child of body represents a fragment</li>
				<li>if the body has got more then one child element, they have to be distinguished by a fragment attribute with given name</li>
				<li>portlet should not contain any style, only html structure</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h3>1.2. Portlet Request</h3>
	Portlet Request is a request made by Portal that retreives all fragments required for the page being requested by the client.
	<h4>1.2.1. Allowed methods are GET or POST, Action requests are either GET with query string or POST, otherwise it is VIEW request</h4>
  	<ul>
  		<li>Portlet must receive all submitted html forms as defined with method="get" or method="post"</li>  		
  		<li>Portlet must receive all cookies it has set on behalf of client request, Portal is responsible to deliver them with next request and expire them accordingly; except cookie path is not applicable.</li>
  		<li>Portlet requests are generally either <b>Action</b> or <b>Render</b> Requests; only one portlet can receive the action and it is responsiblity of the portal to target the correct portlet with the action</li>
  	</ul>	
	<h4>1.2.2. Portlet Request headers</h4>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>User-Agent: &lt;original user agent&gt; + " Portal\s[0-9]\.[0-9]"</strong></li>
		<li><strong>Cookie:</strong> ( private and shared cookies that ara available for the portlet)</li>
		<li><strong>If-Modified-Since: &lt;http timestamp&gt;</strong> - cache validation timestamp</li>
		<li><strong>Pragma: no-cache</strong> - Tells the portlet to flush all private caches; it is optional for portlets to implement this</li>	  
		<li><strong>Portlet-fragments: &lt;list of comma separated fragment names&gt;</strong> - portlets must implement default fragment and can implmenet other fragments</li>
    </ul> 	      	
	<h4>1.2.3. Request entity (POST only)</h4>
	<ul>	 
		<li>Portlets can use any variant of HTTP POST </li>
	</ul>
 
	<h3>1.3. Portlet Response</h3>

	<h4>1.3.1. Response status</h4>	
	<ul>	 
		<li><strong>200 OK</strong> + Portlet HTML Mark-up (see <a href="#ResponseBody">2.3.3. Response Body</a>) </li>
		<li><strong>304 Not Modified</strong></li> 
		<li><small>206 Partial Content (NOT SPECIFIED)</small></li>
	</ul>
 
	<h4>1.3.2. Response headers</h4>	
	<ul>	 
		<li><strong>Content-type: text/html | text/html-fragments</strong> </li>	  
		<li><strong>Set-Cookie:</strong> ( private cookies, e.g. mycookie=123, and shared cookies, e.g. $email=me@there.com )
	</ul>
	<blockquote>		  
	BY DEFAULT RESPONSE IS CACHABLE IF IT IS GET METHOD AND THE HEADERS HAVE NOT CHANGED  
	PORTLET CAN OVERRIDE THIS DEFAULT BEHAVIOUR BY FOLLOWING HEADERS 
	</blockquote>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Last-Modified: &lt;http timestamp&gt;</strong>  - tells the portal that it can validate cache</li>  
	  	<li><strong>Cache-Control: [max-age=&lt;seconds&gt;][, must-revalidate]] </strong>
		  	<ul>
			  	<li><strong>max-age</strong> fields tells the portal or proxy that it can cache the response for given number of seconds</li> 	   
			  	<li><strong>must-revalidate</strong> field tells the portal or proxy that either default or max-age cache must be revalidated
			  		<ul>  
			  	  		<li>portal will issue If-Modified-Since header the moment it needs to use the cached response, if no Last-Modified was returned from last request the last response-time is used</li>
			  	  		<li>protlet which will either respond with 304 Not Modifed, or 200 OK + Response</li>			  	  	
			  			<li>TODO Proxy Specification</li>
			  		</ul>
			  	</li>
		  	</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>
	<h4><a name="ResponseBody">1.3.3. Response Body</a></h4>
	<blockquote>
		This is always a HTML Mark-up with following limitations:
	</blockquote>
		
	<h5>1.3.3.1. Top Level Elements</h5>
	<ul>
		<li>portlet's top level element is &lt;body&gt; therefore no head section is allowed</li>
		<li>immediate children elements of the body must associate themselves with fragments by fragment attribute, e.g. &lt;div fragment="default"&gt;</li>
	</ul>
	<h5>1.3.3.2. Links (@href, @src and @action)</h5>
	<blockquote>
		Only absolute links are allowed in the portlet mark-up, any relative link will produce warning
	</blockquote>		
	<h5>1.3.3.3. Styles</h5>
	<ul>
		<li>no inline style is allowed and should be removed by Portal upon retreival</li>
		<li>class and id will be preserved but every fragment element will have it's class extended with the portlet id</li> 
	</ul>
	
	<h4><a name="">1.4 Cookies</a></h4>
	<ol>
		<li><strong>shared cookies</strong> - begin with '$' symbol and can be accessed from any portlet</li> 
		<li><strong>private cookies</strong> - each portlet has it's own cookie space; this must be transparent so that portlet simply sets and retreives cookies as normal and it is responsibility of the portal to implement the storage</li>
	</ol>
